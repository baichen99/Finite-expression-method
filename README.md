# Finite-expression-method

## intro

This repo is the implementation of "Finite Expression Method for Solving High-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations" [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10121). Official code is [here](https://github.com/LeungSamWai/Finite-expression-method)

## Usage

If you want to use your own dataset/pde, you need to modify the pde.py file.
And just modify train.py and run it.
